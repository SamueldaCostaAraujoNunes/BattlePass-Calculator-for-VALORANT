<h2 style="color:#FF4655">About</h2>

The Application was made so that the player can plan ahead, to be able to complete the Battle Pass without having to "rush" to win all the rewards in time!

The VALORANT Battle Pass renews every 3-4 Months. Each Pass has 50 rewards for those who purchase the Pass, plus 14 free rewards in total. The App generates predictions about the development of the pass as the user plays and the days pass.

This app was originally created by Samuel Nunes and released under the GNU GPLv3.
